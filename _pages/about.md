I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research (LISER) and part of the [ACROSS](https://sites.google.com/view/fredericdocquier/xingb-blog/across) Doctoral Training Unit.

<p align="justify">
My primary research interests are in labor and migration economics, with a focus on the labor market impact of immigration. I have also worked on topics related to development and behavioral economics.

I was previously a junior evaluator for development projects at the Center for Evaluation (CEval). I completed a double master degree in Development Economics at the University of GÃ¶ttingen and in Economics at the University of Stellenbosch. I obtained a BA in International Economics and Development from the University of Bayreuth.
