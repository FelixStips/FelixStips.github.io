I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research (LISER).

I work on migration and labor economics supervised by Bertrand Verheyden, Luisito Bertinelli, and Herbert Br√ºcker. I am part of the [ACROSS Doctoral Training Unit](https://sites.google.com/view/fredericdocquier/xingb-blog/across) and enrolled in the Doctoral School in Economics and Finance at the University of Luxembourg.
