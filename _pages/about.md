Hi, I'm Felix. I am a PostDoc in the [Migration and International Labour Studies](https://iab.de/en/unit/?id=5) department at the [Institute for Employment Research](https://iab.de/en/unit/?id=5) (IAB).

<p align="justify">
My research interests are in labor and migration economics, with a focus on the labor market impact of immigration. I have also worked on topics related to development and behavioral economics.
</p>

Previously, I complete a PhD in Economics at the [Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research](https://www.liser.lu/) (LISER) and worked as a junior evaluator for development projects at the Center for Evaluation (CEval). I completed a double master degree in Development Economics at the University of GÃ¶ttingen and in Economics at the University of Stellenbosch, and obtained a BA in International Economics and Development from the University of Bayreuth.
