I am a PhD candidate at the Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research (LISER) as part of the [ACROSS Doctoral Training Unit](https://sites.google.com/view/fredericdocquier/xingb-blog/across). I work on the "Labour market impacts of human mobility" project supervised by Bertrand Verheyden, Luisito Bertinelli, and Herbert Brücker. I am enrolled in the Doctoral School in Economics and Finance at the University of Luxembourg.
