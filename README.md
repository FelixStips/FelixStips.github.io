Website based on academic pages template. This was forked (then detached) from [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) who used the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. See LICENSE.md. I removed a lot of files compared to the original template. You can fork from here or (better) the original. If you use this, remember to change the website traffic monitoring id and google search id.
